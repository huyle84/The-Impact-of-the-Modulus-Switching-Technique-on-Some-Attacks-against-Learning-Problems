abstract="Despite their popularity, lattice reduction algorithms remain mysterious cryptanalytical tools. Though it has been widely reported that they behave better than their proved worst-case theoretical bounds, no precise assessment has ever been given. Such an assessment would be very helpful to predict the behaviour of lattice-based attacks, as well as to select keysizes for lattice-based cryptosystems. The goal of this paper is to provide such an assessment, based on extensive experiments performed with the NTL library. The experiments suggest several conjectures on the worst case and the actual behaviour of lattice reduction algorithms. We believe the assessment might also help to design new reduction algorithms overcoming the limitations of current algorithms.",

In particular, we study the complexity of solving the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem by reducing the Bounded-Distance Decoding (BDD) problem to uSVP and attempting to solve such instances using the `embedding' approach. We experimentally derive a model for the success of the approach, compare to alternative methods and demonstrate that for the LWE instances considered in this work, reducing to uSVP and solving via embedding compares favorably to other approaches.",

abstract="The well-studied task of learning a linear function with errors is a seemingly hard problem and the basis for several cryptographic schemes. Here we demonstrate additional applications that enjoy strong security properties and a high level of efficiency. Namely, we construct: 1Public-key and symmetric-key cryptosystems that provide security for key-dependent messages and enjoy circular security. Our schemes are highly efficient: in both cases the ciphertext is only a constant factor larger than the plaintext, and the cost of encryption and decryption is only n{\textperiodcentered}polylog(n) bit operations per message symbol in the public-key case, and polylog(n) bit operations in the symmetric-case.1Two efficient pseudorandom objects: a ``weak randomized pseudorandom function'' --- a relaxation of standard PRF --- that can be computed obliviously via a simple protocol, and a length-doubling pseudorandom generator that can be computed by a circuit of n {\textperiodcentered}polylog(n) size. The complexity of our pseudorandom generator almost matches the complexity of the fastest known construction (Applebaum et al., RANDOM 2006), which runs in linear time at the expense of relying on a nonstandard intractability assumption.",

The problem has been shown to be as hard as worst-case lattice problems, and in recent years it has served as the foundation for a plethora of cryptographic applications. Unfortunately, these applications are rather inefficient due to an inherent quadratic overhead in the use of LWE. A main open question was whether LWE and its applications could be made truly efficient by exploiting extra algebraic structure, as was done for lattice-based hash functions (and related primitives).",

We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy.",

	abstract = { Big data technologies are increasingly used for biomedical and health-care informatics research. Large amounts of biological and clinical data have been generated and collected at an unprecedented speed and scale. For example, the new generation of sequencing technologies enables the processing of billions of DNA sequence data per day, and the application of electronic health records (EHRs) is documenting large amounts of patient data. The cost of acquiring and analyzing biomedical data is expected to decrease dramatically with the help of technology upgrades, such as the emergence of new sequencing machines, the development of novel hardware and software for parallel computing, and the extensive expansion of EHRs. Big data applications present new opportunities to discover new knowledge and create novel methods to improve the quality of health care. The application of big data in health care is a fast-growing field, with many new discoveries and methodologies published in the last five years. In this paper, we review and discuss big data application in four major biomedical subdisciplines: (1) bioinformatics, (2) clinical informatics, (3) imaging informatics, and (4) public health informatics. Specifically, in bioinformatics, high-throughput experiments facilitate the research of new genome-wide association studies of diseases, and with clinical informatics, the clinical field benefits from the vast amount of collected patient data for making intelligent decisions. Imaging informatics is now more rapidly integrated with cloud platforms to share medical image data and workflows, and public health informatics leverages big data techniques for predicting and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks, such as Ebola. In this paper, we review the recent progress and breakthroughs of big data applications in these health-care domains and summarize the challenges, gaps, and opportunities to improve and advance big data applications in health care. }

In this paper, we show that for an LWR{\$}{\$}{\_}{\{}m,n,q,p{\}}({\backslash}chi {\_}s){\$}{\$}instance whose parameters satisfy a certain sufficient condition, one can use the BDD strategy to recover the secret with higher advantages if one transforms the LWR instance to an LWE modulo {\$}{\$}q'{\$}{\$}instance with {\$}{\$}q'{\$}{\$}chosen appropriately instead of an LWE modulo q instance. The optimal modulus {\$}{\$}q'{\$}{\$}used in our BDD attack is quite close to p as well as typically smaller than q. Especially, our experiments confirm that our BDD attack is much better in solving search-LWR in terms of root Hermite factor, success probability and even running time either in case the ratio {\$}{\$}{\backslash}log (q)/ {\backslash}log (p){\$}{\$}is big or/and the dimension n is sufficiently large.",

	abstract="Lattice basis reduction is a strong tool in cryptanalysis. In 2017, DeepBKZ was proposed as a new variant of BKZ, and it calls LLL with deep insertions (DeepLLL) as a subroutine alternative to LLL. In this paper, we develop a dual version of DeepBKZ (which we call ``Dual-DeepBKZ''), to reduce the dual basis of an input basis. For Dual-DeepBKZ, we develop a dual version of DeepLLL, and then combine it with the dual enumeration by Micciancio and Walter. It never computes the dual basis of an input basis, and it is as efficient as the primal DeepBKZ. We also demonstrate that Dual-DeepBKZ solves several instances in the TU Darmstadt LWE challenge. We use Dual-DeepBKZ in the bounded distance decoding (BDD) approach for solving an LWE instance. Our experiments show that Dual-DeepBKZ reduces the cost of Liu-Nguyen's BDD enumeration more effectively than BKZ. For the LWE instance of {\$}{\$}(n, {\backslash}alpha ) = (40, 0.015){\$}{\$}(n,$\alpha$)=(40,0.015)(resp., {\$}{\$}(n, {\backslash}alpha ) = (60, 0.005){\$}{\$}(n,$\alpha$)=(60,0.005)), our results are about 2.2 times (resp., 4.0 times) faster than Xu et al.'s results, for which they used BKZ in the fplll library and the BDD enumeration with extreme pruning while we used linear pruning in our experiments.",

The underlying cryptosystem serves as the equivalent of a ``hardware platform'' for HElib, in that it defines a set of operations that can be applied homomorphically, and specifies their cost. This ``platform'' is a SIMD environment (somewhat similar to Intel SSE and the like), but with unique cost metrics and parameters. In this report we describe some of the algorithms and optimization techniques that are used in HElib for data movement, linear algebra, and other operations over this ``platform.''",

To date, it remains the only known way of obtaining unbounded FHE. Unfortunately, bootstrapping is computationally very expensive, despite the great deal of effort that has been spent on improving its efficiency. The current state of the art, due to Gentry, Halevi, and Smart (PKC 2012), is able to bootstrap ``packed'' ciphertexts (which encrypt up to a linear number of bits) in time only quasilinear {\~O}($\lambda$) = $\lambda$ {\textperiodcentered} logO(1) $\lambda$ in the security parameter. While this performance is asymptotically optimal up to logarithmic factors, the practical import is less clear: the procedure composes multiple layers of expensive and complex operations, to the point where it appears very difficult to implement, and its concrete runtime appears worse than those of prior methods (all of which have quadratic or larger asymptotic runtimes).",

We present a new method to homomorphically compute simple bit operations, and refresh (bootstrap) the resulting output, which runs on a personal computer in just about half a second.

One variant takes under over 36 hours to evaluate an entire AES encryption operation, using NTL (over GMP) as our underlying software platform, and running on a large-memory machine. Using SIMD techniques, we can process over 54 blocks in each evaluation, yielding an amortized rate of just under 40 minutes per block. Another implementation takes just over two and a half days to evaluate the AES operation, but can process 720 blocks in each evaluation, yielding an amortized rate of just over five minutes per block. We also detail a third implementation, which theoretically could yield even better amortized complexity, but in practice turns out to be less competitive.",

	abstract="In 2003, Schnorr introduced Random sampling to find very short lattice vectors, as an alternative to enumeration. An improved variant has been used in the past few years by Kashiwabara et al. to solve the largest Darmstadt SVP challenges. However, the behaviour of random sampling and its variants is not well-understood: all analyses so far rely on a questionable heuristic assumption, namely that the lattice vectors produced by some algorithm are uniformly distributed over certain parallelepipeds. In this paper, we introduce lattice enumeration with discrete pruning, which generalizes random sampling and its variants, and provides a novel geometric description based on partitions of the n-dimensional space. We obtain what is arguably the first sound analysis of random sampling, by showing how discrete pruning can be rigorously analyzed under the well-known Gaussian heuristic, in the same model as the Gama-Nguyen-Regev analysis of pruned enumeration from EUROCRYPT '10, albeit using different tools: we show how to efficiently compute the volume of the intersection of a ball with a box, and to efficiently approximate a large sum of many such volumes, based on statistical inference. Furthermore, we show how to select good parameters for discrete pruning by enumerating integer points in an ellipsoid. Our analysis is backed up by experiments and allows for the first time to reasonably estimate the success probability of random sampling and its variants, and to make comparisons with previous forms of pruned enumeration. Our work unifies random sampling and pruned enumeration and show that they are complementary of each other: both have different characteristics and offer different trade-offs to speed up enumeration.",

We illustrate this by solving within half a day a                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                  LWE                                                             instance with dimension                                                                                   {\$}{\$}n=128{\$}{\$}                                                                                            n                          =                          128                                                                                    , modulus                                                                                   {\$}{\$}q=n^{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                            q                          =                                                      n                            2                                                                                                              , Gaussian noise                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha =1/({\backslash}sqrt{\{}n/{\backslash}pi {\}} {\backslash}log ^2 n){\$}{\$}                                                                                            $\alpha$                          =                          1                          /                          (                                                                                    n                              /                              $\pi$                                                                                                            log                            2                                                    n                          )                                                                                     and binary secret, using                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^{\{}28{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                            2                          28                                                                                     samples, while the previous best result based on BKW claims a time complexity of                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^{\{}74{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                            2                          74                                                                                     with                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^{\{}60{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                            2                          60                                                                                     samples for the same parameters.",

In addition, they are the first low-depth PRFs that have no known attack by efficient quantum algorithms. Central to our results is a new ``derandomization'' technique for the learning with errors (LWE) problem which, in effect, generates the error terms deterministically.",

	abstract="The learning with rounding (LWR) problem, introduced by Banerjee, Peikert and Rosen at EUROCRYPT '12, is a variant of learning with errors (LWE), where one replaces random errors with deterministic rounding. The LWR problem was shown to be as hard as LWE for a setting of parameters where the modulus and modulus-to-error ratio are super-polynomial. In this work we resolve the main open problem and give a new reduction that works for a larger range of parameters, allowing for a polynomial modulus and modulus-to-error ratio. In particular, a smaller modulus gives us greater efficiency, and a smaller modulus-to-error ratio gives us greater security, which now follows from the worst-case hardness of GapSVP with polynomial (rather than super-polynomial) approximation factors.",
